    "BentPyramid": "Bent Pyramid of Sneferu (Dahshur)",
    "BentPyramidAbout": "It was called the Bent Pyramid because it was started to rise at an angle of 58 degrees, and when the building reached almost half its height, it was decided to build the upper part at an angle of 43 degrees. The work on its construction took 14 years. It is likely that the reason for taking this shape was that the building began to sink due to the stone loads. In addition, the large angle causes a sharp rise in the pyramid, making it difficult to complete and build the upper part of it. This technique helped Sneferu and his engineers to build a complete pyramid with a new technique next to it called the Red Pyramid, which Sneferu chose as his burial place, about 2 kilometers north of the Bent Pyramid in the town of Dahshur.\nIt can be considered a failed test that Sneferu also did not like, and through it they discovered the technique of building complete pyramids by placing horizontal layers of stones. Each square layer of stones is topped by a smaller layer in area, so that the angle of inclination is 52 degrees, instead of building at an angle of 55 or 43 degrees as was the case with the Bent Pyramid. This shape became the complete shape of the pyramid as we know it today.",

    "RedPyramidAbout": "After the failure of the first pyramid (the Bent Pyramid) of King Sneferu, his engineers discovered during the work that lasted 14 years: the technique of building the complete pyramids as they are known in their current form, by placing horizontal layers of stones, each square layer of stones topped by a smaller layer in area, with the angle of inclination being 52 degrees. Sneferu exploited the new technique to build his giant pyramid and called it the \"Northern Pyramid\" and is called today the \"Red Pyramid\".\nWhich is located about 1.8 kilometers north of the Bent Pyramid in Dahshur. Based on the technique of building Sneferu's Red Pyramid, the pyramids were built in Giza. Khufu, son of Sneferu, built the Great Pyramid on the Giza Plateau and its height reached 157 meters, then his son Khafre followed him and built his pyramid next to his father's pyramid and it was lower than it, then his son Menkaure came and built the third (small) pyramid, and these pyramids were tombs for them.\nIt can be visited from the inside with the same ticket as the Bent Pyramid of Dahshur. But don't go unless you're fit enough to bend down and go deep inside the pyramids. The Red Pyramid has 165 steps and the Bent Pyramid has 225 steps inside.",

    "BlackPyramidAbout": "The Black Pyramid was built by King Amenemhat III during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2040–1640 BC). It is one of the five remaining pyramids of the original ten pyramids at Dahshur in Egypt. It is called the Black Pyramid because of its dark, deteriorating appearance, resembling a pile of rubble. It was built on mud that could not support its own weight, and began to sink, much like the Bent Pyramid of Sneferu. Its outer shell of limestone, the “shining layer,” was stabilized with regular pegs, support beams, and mudstones to prevent subsidence, but it was insufficient; it was eventually abandoned.\nThe ground level contains an entrance to the courtyard and the funerary temple, and is surrounded by two sets of walls, between which are tunnel tombs: a type of burial structure formed by tombs built into natural rock. The pyramid, the stone that crowns the pyramid, was covered with religious inscriptions and symbols, some of which have been removed, leading researchers to conclude that the pyramid was never used.\nBelow ground level in the underground structure lies an intricate network of passageways. The king's quarters have not been touched, and include a huge sarcophagus carved to mimic the outer wall of Djoser's step pyramid at Saqqara, and a canopic jar, although he was not buried there. There are four burial chambers whose occupants are unknown.\n\nWith the same ticket as the Bent Pyramid of Dahshur.",

It included a harem, a selamlik, servants' rooms, a horse stable, and gardens. Following the July Revolution, many of its components were demolished, and all that remained of the palace was this place, the \"tea kiosk\", which consists of a main hall, a music hall, 3 rooms, a bathroom, and 2 terraces. The palace's visitors and residents used to drink tea there while listening to music in the hall designed for this purpose, the roof of which was covered with a dome so that the singer would not need a microphone. The palace is surrounded on the southwestern side by a wooden balcony overlooking the Nile through three wooden arches, the ceiling of which is decorated with plant and geometric motifs. The palace facades are crowned by a wooden flap in the form of an Egyptian cornice. This remaining part is the “Salamlek”, while the “Haramlek” has been demolished.\nIn the middle of the palace’s outer courtyard is the “Nilometer”, which is considered one of the oldest Islamic monuments. It was used to estimate the size of the Nile flood each year, and on the basis of it the value of taxes and tributes was estimated for the following year. There is also a small building attached to the palace that has been designated as a museum for the Lady of Arabic Singing “Umm Kulthum”, which contains her belongings and the medals and decorations she received.

This place was associated with an atmosphere of love and romance. Its beauty is not only in the wonderful design, but also in the use of design materials from Aswan clay mixed with asromil and red sand to create architectural formations in the shape of fish gills. The garden consists of an entrance with two openings resembling the opening of fish gills, and behind it is the lobby area. On the side of the two openings there are two side fins behind which are the four garden paths.\n\nAs for the interior, it was taken into account that it should be in the form of paths or cavities inside coral reefs located in the depths of the sea. If you look at the ceiling of one of the paths, you will find it as if it is one of the other cavities made by the waves to play melodies when the air passes through it to resemble the movement of water, through the movement of the air rushing from the four entrances moving between the caves.\nThe garden includes 49 tanks for various and rare fish, and it also has a panorama to display stuffed fish, and other sections that include types of turtles and marine reptiles that live in swamps and rivers. There is also a large basin in the front of the garden that contains predatory fish such as sharks...\n\nThere are also paths outside that separate green spaces containing rare trees.",
    "Sphinx": "Sphinx",
    "SphinxAbout": "It is the guardian of the Giza Plateau: a statue of a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a man, one of the oldest known monumental sculptures, believed to have been built during the reign of King Khafre (2558 BC - 2532 BC): to represent him combining the strength of a lion with the wisdom of a man.\n\nAt some point, the Giza necropolis was abandoned, and the drifting sands buried the Sphinx on its shoulders. The first documented attempt at excavation dates back to around 1400 BC, when the young Thutmose IV assembled a team and managed, after much effort, to excavate the forepaws, placing between them a granite slab, known as the Sphinx Stela, inscribed with the following excerpt:\n\n“… The royal son, Thutmose, walking at midday and sitting under the shadow of this great god, was overcome by sleep and fell asleep at the very moment when Ra was at the top [of the sky]. He found that the majesty of this great god spoke to him with his mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: Look at me, Consider me, my son, Thutmose; I am your father, Hermakhis-Khupri-Ra-Tum; I give you dominion over my domain, dominion over life… See my actual state in which you may protect all my ideal limbs. Cover me with the sands of the desert upon which you are placed. Save me…”.\n\nThere are suggestions by scholars that the Sphinx was the focus of sun worship in the Early Dynastic period, before the Giza Plateau became a necropolis in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2686–2134 BC). This is linked to the conclusion that the Sphinx, the Sphinx Temple, the Causeway, and the Funerary Temple of Khafre are all part of a complex that predates the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 2613–2494 BC).\n\nAs described by travelers: John Lawson Stoddard:\n“The Sphinx’s effect is such that it delights us when we look at it, for it has no charm in itself. The waves of the desert rose to his breast, as if wrapping the beast in a piece of gold. The face and head were mutilated by fanatics. The mouth, whose beauty had once been admired, was now expressionless. Yet the remains of Egyptian antiquity stand majestic and silent in the presence of the terrible desert—the symbol of eternity. Here the empire of the past is opposed to time; we gaze forever into a future that will still be far away when we, like all who have gone before us and looked upon his face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.”.",

    "KafyMuseAbout": "Constantinos Petro Cavafy was born in 1863 in Alexandria to Greek parents who had grown up in the Greek community of Constantinople (Turkey). He settled with his family for a time in Liverpool, then returned to Alexandria. In 1882, the Urabi Revolution caused the family to move again, albeit temporarily, to Constantinople. Three years later, he returned to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. He worked as a journalist. He then took up a position in the Ministry of Public Works for thirty years. From 1891 to 1904, he published his poetry in newspaper form, and only to his close friends; he consistently refused to publish his work officially, preferring to share it through local newspapers and magazines, or even print it himself and give it to anyone interested.\nHe died of throat cancer on 29 April 1933. His fame has grown since his death, since his friend E. M. Forster introduced his poems to the English-speaking world in 1923. Cavafy wrote 155 poems, the most important of which were written after his fortieth birthday and were officially published two years after his death. Dozens remained unfinished or in sketch form.\nTwenty years later he was an inspiration to a new generation of semi-nihilistic poets after the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War. He played a major role in the revival of Greek poetry and its recognition at home and abroad. His poetry is taught in schools in Greece and Cyprus, and in universities around the world.\nHis poems are often brief but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and settings that played roles in Greek culture. Cavafy drew his themes from personal experience, combined with a deep and broad knowledge of history, especially the Hellenistic period. He wrote many pseudo-historical poems. In 1911, he wrote Ithaca, inspired by the journey of the Homeric Odysseus back to his native island; The theme of the poem is the destination that produces the journey of life. \nThe Greek Onassis Foundation undertook the restoration of the house where he lived for the last twenty-five years of his life: it contains eight rooms that, with the generous permission of the Onassis Foundation, include texts written in his handwriting, Cavafy's burial mask, and furniture that is almost identical to what his house used to be, in addition to a library that includes books about his life, some of his pictures, international books written about him in different languages, his poetry collections, and a statue of him by the visual artist Mahmoud Moussa.",

The slender columns and wide spacing indicate the influence of Greco-Roman traditions. There are also many crosses carved on the walls of the temple at the beginning of the spread of Christianity in the region, and thus the Holy of Holies was later used as a church sanctuary.\nBetween 1962 and 1963, the temple, like other Nubian temples, was moved from its original location on Kalabsha Island to New Kalabsha Island to save it after the Nile water level rose following the construction of the High Dam."

He rebuilt and expanded the temple of Amenhotep III by building structures in front of the pylon.\nThe temple of Ramesses was built to honor the two great gods Amun-Re and Ra-Horakhty. Its entrance is preceded by a path adorned with sphinxes in the form of crouching lions.\nIn the 5th century AD it was used as a church during the Roman persecution, when the statues were destroyed and some of the temple's reliefs were covered with a layer of plaster that helped preserve the original reliefs for future generations; the painted scenes depict Ramesses worshipping the sacred boats of Amun. The face of Amun, located in the outer courtyard of the temple, was transformed into St. Peter, and when the layers of shell were removed, the drawings showed Ramesses II offering flowers to St. Peter."
